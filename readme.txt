This is a modified fork of "AllTheMons", originally created by EasySqueeze.
It is assumed that by downloading this fork, you already know the general gists and rules of that pack--that being, do not use it on public multiplayer servers.

As for the purpose of this fork, it is meant to add every Pokémon, and with high quality models. But at the end of the day, it's all about finding and catching new Pokémon--so what are you waiting for?
